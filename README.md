# Applied-Robotics-ROS-system-control
Controlling 8DOF robots through ROS system to conplete tasks.
This repository contains the coursework projects for **Robotics 2: Applied Robotics**.  
It focuses on modeling, motion planning, and manipulation of the **DE NIRO robot** using **ROS** and **Gazebo**.  

The work is split into three courseworks:  
- **#Robot Kinematics:** Robot modeling, kinematics, inverse kinematics, Jacobian computation, and PID control.  
- **Robot Interactions:** Motion planning techniques including configuration space, waypoints, potential fields, and probabilistic roadmaps.  
- **Motion Planning:** Manipulation and interaction tasks, including end-effector control, pick-and-place, velocity control, and redundancy resolution.  

### Coursework 1 ‚Äì Kinematics & Control  
- Constructed Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) table.  
- Implemented forward and inverse kinematics in Python.  
- Derived and coded the Jacobian matrix.  
- Designed and tuned a PID controller.  

### Coursework 2 ‚Äì Motion Planning  
- Built C-space representations (square and circular masks).  
- Implemented waypoint navigation (manual + Dijkstra‚Äôs shortest path).  
- Developed and tuned a Potential Field Algorithm.  
- Designed a Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) planner.  

### Coursework 3 ‚Äì Manipulation & Redundancy  
- Controlled end-effector orientation using Euler angles and quaternions.  
- Implemented pick-and-place tasks with position and velocity control.  
- Applied inverse kinematics with Jacobians for trajectory tracking.  
- Used Null Space Projection for redundant manipulators.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
